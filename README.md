This is the repository containing our CS550 project. The team members are:
- Aditya Sankhla (12140060)
- Aditya Vinay Dubey (12140100)
- Tushar Bansal (12141680)

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a portal which will take in the patients (client) X-Ray along with a list of symptoms the client is suffering from through a chat bot and output a detailed report which will highlight the possible diseases that the patient might have based on an indepth analysis of the X-Ray along with the patient symptoms.

## Mid-Evaluation Progress
- Performed in-depth EDA and visualisation of the dataset and trained several CNN models on this dataset.
- Successfully trained a multimodal (14 classes) image classification model with high accuracy and recall.
- Developed a prototype portal (GUI) using tkinter.
- Implemented a simple hugging face NLP model to classify the diseases based on the user's text and the context provided.
