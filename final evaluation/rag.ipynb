What is pneumonia? - Pneumonia is a serious infection and/or inflammation of \\nthe lungs that causes mild to severe illness in people of all ages when the air sacs \\nin the lungs fill with pus and other fluid. Under those conditions the patient has \\nincreased difficulty breathing  as oxygen has trouble entering the blood from the \\nlungs. Too little oxygen in the blood causes the body’s cells and organs to fail and \\nmay even cause death. Prior to the antibiotic era (pre -1945), pneumonia was the \\nprimary cause of death in the United Sta tes.  \\n2. What are the symptoms of pneumoni a - The onset of pneumonia can vary \\nfrom gradual to sudden. Signs of pneumonia can include coughing, fever, fatigue, \\nnausea, vomiting, rapid breathing or shortness of breath, chills, or chest pain. In \\nthe most seve re cases, the patient may experience shaking chills, chattering teeth, \\nsevere chest pain, and a cough that produces rust -colored or greenish mucus. A', metadata={'source': 'pneumonia.pdf', 'page': 0, 'start_index': 0}), Document(page_content=\"severe chest pain, and a cough that produces rust -colored or greenish mucus. A \\nperson's temperature may rise as high as 105oF. The patient sweats profusely and \\nbreathing and pulse rate increase rapidly. Lips and nail beds may have a bluish \\ncolor due to lack of oxygen in the blood. A patient's mental state may become \\nconfused or delirious. Certain people are more likely to become ill with pneumonia. \\nThis includes adults 65 years of age or  older and children younger than 5 years of \\nage. People up through 64 years of age who have underlying medical conditions \\n(like diabetes or HIV/AIDS) and people 19 through 64 who smoke cigarettes or \\nhave asthma are also at increased risk for getting pneumo nia.  \\n3. What causes Pneumonia? – The most common causes of pneumonia are \\nbacterial or viral infection; however, pneumonia may have several different causes:  \\na. The most common bacterial cause of pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae\", metadata={'source': 'pneumonia.pdf', 'page': 0, 'start_index': 908}), Document(page_content='a. The most common bacterial cause of pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae \\n(pneumococcus). Bacte ria that can produce pneumonia such as Streptococcus \\npneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus are often present \\nin the throats of healthy people. Additionally, Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a frequent \\nbacterial cause of community -acquired pn eumonia.  \\nb. The most common viral causes of pneumonia are influenza, parainfluenza, and \\nrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Viral pneumonia often occurs as a consequence of \\nviral respiratory infections.  \\nc. Fungal organisms, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii , may cause pneumonia in \\nimmunocompromised persons.

Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you aspirate foreign matter into your lungs, \\nmost often when the contents of you r stomach enter your lungs after you vomit. \\nThis can occur when a brain injury affects your normal gag reflex or consuming too \\nmuch alcohol causes unconsciousness. Diseases which cause difficulty swallowing \\nsuch as ALS, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke may also lead to aspiration \\npneumonia.  \\ne. Hospital -acquired pneumonia is the second most common healthcare -associated \\ninfection in the United States. It is caused by the same pathogens that can cause \\nbacterial or viral community -acquired pneumonias but may be  more likely to be \\ncaused by multi -drug resistant organisms or other agents more common in the \\nhospital than in the community.  \\nf. Ventilator -associated pneumonia may occur in any person who is on a ventilator. \\nVentilators are used to help a patient breath  by giving oxygen through a tube', metadata={'source': 'pneumonia.pdf', 'page': 1, 'start_index': 0}), Document(page_content='Ventilators are used to help a patient breath  by giving oxygen through a tube \\nplaced in a patient’s mouth or nose, or through a hole in the front of the neck. \\nWhile ventilators are often life -saving, they also increase a patient’s chance of \\ngetting pneumonia by making it easier for pathogens to get i nto the patient’s lungs. \\nThe risk of developing ventilator -associated pneumonia is highest during the first \\nfew days after intubation.  \\n4. How do you treat pneumonia? – The treatment for pneumonia depends on its \\ncause and successful treatment is most likel y to occur when pneumonia is detected \\nearly. The drugs used to fight your pneumonia are determined by your doctor. \\nPrescribed medications must be taken as instructed, otherwise the pneumonia may \\nrecur.
