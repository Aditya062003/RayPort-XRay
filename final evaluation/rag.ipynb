It is associated with structural lung changes due to chronic inflammation from\\nprolonged exposure to noxious particles or gases most commonly cigarette smoke. Chronic inflammation causes airway narrowing and decreased lung recoil. The disease often presents with symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and sputum\\nproduction. Symptoms can range from being asymptomatic to respiratory failure. [1]\\nEtiology\\nCOPD is caused by prolonged exposure to harmful particles or gases. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD worldwide. Other causes may include second-hand smoke, environmental and occupational exposures,\\nand alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD).

Prevalence increases with age and it is currently the third most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2015, the prevalence of COPD was 174\\nmillion and there were approximately 3.2 million deaths due to COPD worldwide. However, the prevalence is likely to be underestimated due to the underdiagnosis of COPD. [1][2]\\nPathophysiology\\nCOPD is an inflammatory condition involving the airways, lung parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature. The process is thought to involve oxidative stress and protease-antiprotease imbalances. Emphysema describes one of the\\nstructural changes seen in COPD where there is destruction of the alveolar air sacs (gas-exchanging surfaces of the lungs) leading to obstructive physiology. In emphysema, an irritant (e.g., smoking) causes an inflammatory', metadata={'source': 'disease_compendium.pdf', 'page': 9, 'start_index': 2389}), Document(page_content='response.

AATD is caused by misfolding of the mutated\\nprotein which can accumulate in the liver. AATD should be suspected in COPD patients who present with liver damage. As opposed to smoking-related emphysema, AATD primarily involves the lower lobes.

The reduction in ventilation or increase in physiologic dead space leads to CO2 retention. Pulmonary hypertension may occur due to diffuse vasoconstriction from hypoxemia. [1][3]\\nAcute exacerbations of COPD are common and usually occur due to a trigger (e.g., bacterial or viral pneumonia, environmental irritants).

It is a common clinical presentation to emergency departments, urgent care centers, and primary care offices. About 5% of adults have an episode of acute\\nbronchitis each year. An estimated 90% of these seek medical advice for the same. In the United States, acute bronchitis is among the top ten most common illnesses among outpatients.[1][2][3]\\nEtiology', metadata={'source': 'disease_compendium.pdf', 'page': 10, 'start_index': 902}), Document(page_content='Etiology\\nAcute bronchitis is caused by infection of the large airways commonly due to viruses and is usually self-limiting. Bacterial infection is uncommon. Approximately 95% of acute bronchitis in healthy adults is secondary to viruses. It\\ncan sometimes be caused by allergens, irritants, and bacteria. Irritants include smoke inhalation, polluted air inhalation, dust, among others.[4]\\nEpidemiology\\nAcute bronchitis is one of the common presentations in any healthcare setting. It is estimated that every year, 5% of the general population reports an episode of acute bronchitis, accounting for more than 10 million office visits\\nyearly.[5] Like most of the viral diseases of the respiratory tract, acute bronchitis is commonly seen during the flu season. In the United States, flu season is common during autumn and winter. It can follow any viral upper', metadata={'source': 'disease_compendium.pdf', 'page': 10, 'start_index': 1768}), Document(page_content='respiratory infection (URI). The common pathogens are respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and other similar viruses.\\nFactors like a history of smoking, living in a polluted place, crowding, and a history of asthma, are all risk factors for acute bronchitis. In some people, acute bronchitis can be triggered by particular allergens like pollens, perfume,\\nand vapors.\\nWhen the infection is bacterial, the isolated pathogens are usually the same as those responsible for community-acquired pneumonia, for example, Streptococcus pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus.[6][7]\\nPathophysiology\\nAcute bronchitis is the result of acute inflammation of the bronchi secondary to various triggers, most commonly viral infection, allergens, pollutants, etc. Inflammation of the bronchial wall leads to mucosal thickening, epithelial-', metadata={'source': 'disease_compendium.pdf', 'page': 10, 'start_index': 2625}), Document(page_content='cell desquamation, and denudation of the basement membrane. At times, a viral upper respiratory infection can progress to infection of the lower respiratory tract resulting in acute bronchitis.[8]\\nHistory and Physical\\nPatients with acute bronchitis present with a productive cough, malaise, difficulty breathing, and wheezing. Usually, their cough is the predominant complaint and the sputum is clear or yellowish, although sometimes it can be\\npurulent. Purulent sputum does not correlate with bacterial infection or antibiotic use.[9] Cough after acute bronchitis typically persists for 10 to 20 days but occasionally may last for 4 or more weeks. The median duration of cough\\nafter acute bronchitis is 18 days.[10] Paroxysms of cough accompanied by inspiratory whoop or post-tussive emesis should raise concerns for pertussis.

Tachycardia can be present reflecting fever as well as dehydration secondary\\nto the viral illness. The rest of the systems are typically within normal limits.\\nEvaluation\\nAcute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis based on history, past medical history, lung exam, and other physical findings. Oxygen saturation plays an important role in judging the severity of the disease along with the pulse rate,\\ntemperature, and respiratory rate. No further workup is needed if vital signs are normal and there are no exam findings suggestive of pneumonia. An exception to this rule is elderly patients >75 years old.

Occasionally, the chest x-ray demonstrates increased interstitial markings consistent with the thickening of bronchial walls. A chest x-ray differentiates\\npneumonia from acute bronchitis when infiltrates are seen. Evidence-based guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend obtaining a CXR only when heart rate > 100/min, respiratory rate >24\\nbreaths/min, oral body temperature > 38 degrees C, and chest examination findings of egophony or fremitus.[5]\\nA complete blood count and chemistry may be ordered as a workup for fever.

Reversibility of FEV1 >15% is reported in 17% of patients.[5] Airflow obstruction and bronchial\\nhyperresponsiveness typically resolve in 6 weeks.\\nTreatment / Management\\nAcute bronchitis is self-limiting and treatment is typically symptomatic and supportive therapy. For cough relief, nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapy should be offered.

Antitussive agents like dextromethorphan and codeine are frequently used in clinical practice to suppress cough based on their\\neffectiveness in chronic bronchitis and studies on cough in the common cold. No randomized trials exist to evaluate their effectiveness in acute bronchitis. Codeine should be avoided due to its addictive potential. Data on the use\\nof a mucolytic agent is conflicting. \\nBeta-agonists are routinely used in acute bronchitis patients with wheezing. Small randomized control trials on beta-agonists for cough in acute bronchitis had mixed results. A Cochrane review of five trials demonstrated no\\nsignificant benefit of beta-agonists on daily cough except for a small benefit in a subgroup of patients with wheezing and airflow obstruction at baseline.[11] A more recent Cochrane review demonstrated similar results.[12]', metadata={'source': 'disease_compendium.pdf', 'page': 10, 'start_index': 7095}), Document(page_content='Analgesic and antipyretic agents may be used to treat associated malaise, myalgia, and fever.

Typically the steroid is used as short-term burst therapy. Sometimes a longer tapering dose of steroids might be\\nwarranted, especially in patients with underlying asthma or COPD.[13][14]\\nACCP guidelines recommend against antibiotic use in simple acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults. A Cochrane review of nine randomized, controlled trials of antibiotic agents showed a minor reduction in the total duration\\nof cough (0.6 days).

Despite these recommendations, a large proportion of\\npatients with acute bronchitis are prescribed antibiotics. No data exist to justify the prospect of cough being less severe or less prolonged with antibiotic therapy. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended when a treatable pathogen is\\nidentified such as influenza or pertussis. In patients with influenza infection, oseltamivir or zanamivir should be promptly started. Macrolides are the treatment of choice for pertussis along with 5 days of isolation.
